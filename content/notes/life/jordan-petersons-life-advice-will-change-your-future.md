{{< note title="Goal your life" >}}



You should have things like:
- Family
- Friends
- Career
- Education goals
- Plans for time outside of work
- Attention to your mental and physical health
- …

unless all you have is misery and suffering

Figure out **who it is you are trying to be**
1. Specify your goal, have a vision for your life, things that justify your effort
2. `Want to be, not should be`

Turn down to micro routines
1. How does that instantiate itself day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year → a schedule  
1. Set the schedule up so `YOU HAVE THE DAY YOU WANT` with some responsibility with the day
2. If you are productive `50%` this week, aim for `50.1%` the next week or `50.5%`
1. Things will start to loop back positively and spiral you upward

What you do now is going to multiply its effects in the future

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
Now if it is `$50/h`, and you waste 6 hours a day <br> → You are wasting about `$2,000 a week`, `$100,000 a year` → EVERY OF YOUR HOUR HAS A COST (PRICE)

If for ten years, if you didn’t avoid doing what you knew you needed to do, you your own definitions, what would you be like!<br>
→ You get stronger, stronger and stronger. `We do not know the limits to that`. <br> Perhaps the reason you are suffering and unbearably can be left at your feet because you are know everything you could be.
{{< /alert >}}

Generally, we are wasting 5, 6 hours a day

- Inefficient studying
- Watching things on Youtube that not only do you not want to watch, that you don’t even care about, that make you feel horrible after watching, after you are done <br>→ That is probably 4 hours right there
    - That is `25 hours a week`, `100 hours a month` (2,5 full work weeks) → `half a year of work` per year
    - If your time is `$20`, which is radical underestimate, if you are waiting 20 hours a week, `you’re wasting $50,000 per year`
    - It is even worse if you introduce the habit of wasting time in your life style

WHAT WOULD HAPPENS IF YOU JUST STOPPED WASTING THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE IN FRONT OF YOU
{{< /alert >}}
Who knows how much more efficient you can? → 10 times more efficient, 20 times more efficient
* pareto distribution (The 80 - 20 principal)

**You have no idea how efficient efficient people get**

{{< note title="Social network" >}}

Your are at the center of a network. You’re a node in a network.

The things you do, they’re like dropping a stone in a pond, the ripples move outward and affect things in ways that you can’t fully comprehend
{{< alert type="warning" >}}
The things that you do and you don’t do are far more important than you think

# a summary about you
summary: |
  I studied Japanese at the university in Vietnam and started my career in 2011 as a Japanese interpreter. I have interpreter experiences in automobile industry and IT industry. In 2015, I studied IT and have being working as a Web developer since 2016.  In 2018, I moved to Osaka, Japan, where I continue my IT engineer career journey.

  At work, I develop CLI tools and HTTP applications with Go and PHP.
  I also build E2E test automation system for the Web application using GCP.

  My everyday usually starts around 4:00, a habit I have maintained since 2020. 
  As a self-learning developer, I use [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/pqa-dev) to acquire new skills and update my knowledge.

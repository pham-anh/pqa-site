# a summary about you
summary: |
  I studied Japanese at the university in Vietnam and started my career in 2011 as a Japanese interpreter in the automobile industry, then in the IT industry. After that, I studied IT and have become a Web developer since 2016.

  At work, I develop CLI tools and HTTP applications with Go and PHP.
  I also build E2E test automation system for the Web application using on GCP.

  My everyday usually starts around 4:00 AM. This is a habit I have been trying to keep since 2020. 
  As a self-learning developer, I am using [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/pqa-dev) to learn new skills as well as to update my knowledge.
